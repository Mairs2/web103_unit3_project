## Notes

One challenge I faced was getting the images for each event/artist to show on the page. I used the tiny urls first to store the images but they would still not show. I then used the actual url for the images but the problem still continued. I asked AI wya this was hapening and I learned that some websited would block requests for the image in their database that was why the images were not showing. Ihad to download the images and put them in a directory in the client folder then call them in the data file in the server/data folder. Now the images work though that was not the most efficent and best way to do it. Also Github was not allowing me to upload the gif. I spent over an hour trying to do that, so I just uploaded a video instead
